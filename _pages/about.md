Hi! My name is Julia Andreasen, I'm a glaciologist and atmospheric scientist from the heart of Washington, DC, and I love ice. Currently, I am a NASA FINESST Fellow and graduate student in the Land and Atmospheric Science program at the University of Minnesota. I began my Ph.D. in the Fall of 2020 with my advisor Dr. Peter Neff and am studying the ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions of Antarctica's dynamic West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) coast. 

Prior to Minnesota, I attended the University of Leeds and obtained a Master of Research in Climate and Atmospheric Science under the supervision of Dr. Anna Hogg and with the Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling (CPOM). I also have a Bachelor of Science degree in Atmospheric Sciences with a minor in Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies degree from The Ohio State University.
